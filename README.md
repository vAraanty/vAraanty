  Real-time messaging app built with Rails 8 + Hotwire. Explores Turbo Streams, Stimulus, Auth0 authentication, OpenSearch for chat history search, and Stripe for subscription logic.
  Goal: Deepen practical experience with real-time Rails and third-party integrations.

- **Auto Parts Marketplace**  
  A GraphQL-based Rails API for managing flashcard decks and cards (CRUD).
